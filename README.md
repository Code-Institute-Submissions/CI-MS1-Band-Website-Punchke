## **"Punchke" Band Website**


This website was built for the purposes of my first independent project at Code Institute.

This was a static front end project: the requirements were to write HTML5 and CSS3 code to bulid a website of my own choosing i.e. design.

The general idea, or rather the subject matter - to choose to build a band website - stemmed from one of Code Institute's suggestions for the project's topic: to design a website for either a real or a fictional band.

Firstly, choosing a real band seemed easier to do - there could be actual band photos, record covers, music, and overall band esthetic to draw upon. And this band - Punčke ("Punčke being the original spelling, to be pronunced as if it was spelled "Punchke") - might have the first band to come to mind to me.

I would consider myself a longtime fan of the band: listenintg to their music and gong to their shows over a span of years. 
Being a part of their audience, I figured I have an impression and have formed a view of their esthetic that would help in making the design choices for the website.

Furthermore, the band didn't have a website that I was aware of - so I couldn't have been "too much" influenced by that, which made things additionally interesting; the band did have a social media presence on sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Youtube, as well as a Bandcamp page.

Additionally, it was not a high-profile band, so I didn't think they'd mind in me using the for my project like this. 
I also have at one point in the past exchanged some emails with the band, and even met them on one occassion - all of this, again, aiding to the overall impression they wouldn't mind me using them for this project.
But I have not contacted to check this.

To mention lastly that the band has recently retired.
